# Feed Reader Testing Project

This project is part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

Students are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and started writing their first test. The task is to complete the test suite. Optionally, the student can use a more recent version of Jasmine.

## Goal

Learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## Why is this important?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
